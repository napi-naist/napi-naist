<h1>The NAIST Project for Interns (NAPI) Program</h1>

<p>The NAIST Project for Interns (NAPI) offers yearly internship opportunities for students and faculty coming from the School of Science and Engineering (SOSE) of the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) in the Philippines. The internship is held in the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), a school for graduate studies situated in the advanced technology research area of Osaka-Nara-Kyoto.</p>

<p>NAIST is an institution of higher learning that ranks among the best in Japan. It is a school that fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, autonomy, and independent thinking. Interns will find that the school provides rich research exposure and opportunities within its laboratories.</p>

<p>In 2006, NAPI was first held as part of the Excellent Student Program of the Graduate School of Information Science, now the Division of Information Science. This program allows students of good academic standing to submit proposals for a project that the school is going to fund.</p>

<p>Edison Yu, an alumni of ADMU, submitted the proposal for a project that would allow NAIST to promote itself abroad and at the same time give students and faculty members from the partner university a chance to be immersed in the latest technologies and research activities in the institute. The project allowed several students and faculty members from the Departments of Electronics, Computer, and Communications Engineering and Department of Information Systems and Computer Science of ADMU to visit NAIST in 2006.</p>

<p>Since then, NAPI has become a yearly project for both universities and has also encouraged a good number of students to pursue graduate studies in NAIST. It continues to strengthen the relationship between the two universities in terms of research and collaborations.</p>
